# falsum -- Rust to LLVM compiler
## Created for educational purposes!

This project aims to create educational compiler from [Rust](rust-lang.org) language to [LLVM](http://llvm.org/) in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).

## Dependencies

* [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) - `sudo apt-get install haskell-platform`
* [clang](http://clang.llvm.org/) - `sudo apt-get install clang`
* llvm-3.8 - `sudo apt-get install llvm-3.8 libedit-dev`

## How to compile and run programs in LLVM source inputs

LLVM source files have `*.llvm` file extension. Files can be compiled using *clang*.

```
clang hello.ll -o hello
```

# Development
## Stack Tool

It's a management tool (similar to cabal).
Here is a [guide](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) for the installation.


## Build & Run

How to build our `falsum` app:

```
stack build
```

How to run it:

```
stack exec falsum
```

## Tests

Tests are executed by:

```
stack test
```

## Source code formatting

You have to install `hfmt`:

```
stack install hfmt
```

and run the formatting itself:

```
stack exec hfmt -- -w
```
